== DESCRIPTION:

This gem is a wrapper around active resource to access the rest api exposed by mingle.
It provides a easy way to communicate with mingle. For the library to work you need to
enable basic authentication (not enabled by default) in Mingle. See below to enable 
basic authentication in Mingle.

Enable basic authentication in Mingle
-------------------------------------

1) Go to Mingle DataDir

2) Open YAML file <Mingle DataDir>/config/auth_config.yml

3) Set 'basic_authentication_enabled' to 'true' (without the quotes) if it is not so

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

It gives you access to projects in the mingle instance, cards under the project and also
attachments for a particular card.

== SYNOPSIS:

A) Getting all the projects for a particular instance
--------------------------------------------------

Suppose you want to connect to the mingle instance hosted at http://localhost:8080 where the
username is 'testuser' and password is 'password'.

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
projs = m_c.projects

projs is an array of active resource objects

B) Getting a particular project
----------------------------

Before you access a particular project you need to set the project id for the mingle client 
object. You can do that in two ways. Supposing you are trying to access a project with an
identifier of 'great_mingle_project'

WARNING : project identifier and project name are different. If you named your project as
'Great Mingle Project' it's identifier is by default 'great_mingle_project'. To be sure what
the identifier of a project is you should look at the url in mingle in the particular project
you are trying to access. It should be something like 'http://localhost:8080/projects/great_mingle_project'

1) Set at initialize time

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password', 'great_mingle_project')
m_c.project

2) Set an attribute later

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
m_c.project

C) Getting cards for a particular project
--------------------------------------

Get a mingle client object initialized as in SECTION B. Then call the cards method.

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
m_c.cards

cards will be an array of activeresoure objects.
