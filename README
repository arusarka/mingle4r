== DESCRIPTION:

This gem is a wrapper around active resource to access the rest api exposed by mingle
(http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-agile-project-management).It provides a easy 
way to communicate with mingle. For the library to work you need to enable basic authentication
(not enabled by default) in Mingle. See below to enable basic authentication in Mingle.

However if you are planning to connect and work with mingle from the terminal, then there
is another gem mingle-mingle which you should look at. This library provides a very easy
api to write code to work with mingle (see the examples below) but thats it.

Enable basic authentication in Mingle
-------------------------------------

1) Go to Mingle DataDir

2) Open YAML file <Mingle DataDir>/config/auth_config.yml

3) Set 'basic_authentication_enabled' to 'true' (without the quotes) if it is not so

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

It gives you access to projects in the mingle instance, cards under the project and also
attachments for a particular card. 

== SYNOPSIS:

The api now supports both mingle 2 and mingle 3. The gem tries as much as possible to hide
away the internal details. But some api features are only supported in mingle 3 only (like
murmurs). For that check the api documentation for the mingle instance(located at 
<mingle instance host>/help/index)

In all the documentation below you can replace Mingle4r::MingleClient with MingleClient.
Its an alias for easy use.

A) Getting all the projects for a particular instance
-----------------------------------------------------

Suppose you want to connect to the mingle instance hosted at http://localhost:8080 where the
username is 'testuser' and password is 'password'.

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
projs = m_c.projects

projs is an array of active resource objects

B) Getting a particular project
-------------------------------

Before you access a particular project you need to set the project id for the mingle client 
object. You can do that in two ways. Supposing you are trying to access a project with an
identifier of 'great_mingle_project'

WARNING : project identifier and project name are different. If you named your project as
'Great Mingle Project' it's identifier is by default 'great_mingle_project'. To be sure what
the identifier of a project is you should look at the url in mingle in the particular project
you are trying to access. It should be something like 'http://localhost:8080/projects/great_mingle_project'

		1) Set at initialize time

		m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password',
		'great_mingle_project')
		m_c.project

		2) Set an attribute later

		m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
		m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
		m_c.project

C) Getting cards for a particular project
--------------------------------------

Get a mingle client object initialized as in SECTION B. Then call the cards method.

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
m_c.project.cards

cards will be an array of activeresoure objects.

D) Getting custom properties for a card
---------------------------------------

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
card = m_c.project.cards[0]
card.custom_properties => returns an array of hashes, {property name => property value}

However this gives only custom properties, not all the properties.

E) Getting a particular property
--------------------------------

gets the value of a property. The property name given should be the same as seen in Mingle.

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
card = m_c.project.cards[0]
card.property_value('Status')

F) Setting a particular property
--------------------------------

sets the value of the property. The property name given should be the same as in Mingle and
the value given should be one of the values that Mingle accepts in case of a managed list

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
defect_card = m_c.project.cards.first
defect_card.property_value('Status', 'Closed')

G) Adding comment to a particular card
--------------------------------------

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
defect_card = m_c.project.cards[0]
defect_card.add_comment('Not able to reproduce')

H) Getting all comments for a card(only in mingle 3.0)
------------------------------------------------------
m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
defect_card = m_c.project.cards.first
defect_cards.comments

I) Attachments
--------------
m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
defect_card = m_c.project.cards.first
defect_card.attachments

  1) Downloading a particular attachment
  --------------------------------------
  
  attachment = defect_card.attachments.first
  attachment.save('page.css')
  
  2) Uploading an attachment
  --------------------------
  
  defect_card.upload_attachment('page-screenshot.jpg')
  
J) Murmurs(only in Mingle 3.0)
------------------------------

  1) Get the murmurs for a project
  --------------------------------
  
  m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
  m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
  project = m_c.project
  project.murmurs
  
  2) Get the murmurs associated with a card
  -----------------------------------------
  
  card = project.cards.first
  card.murmurs
  
  3) post a murmur(hooray!)
  -------------------------
  project.post_murmur('my first murmur, I am excited!')
  
K) Get all transitions for a card(only in Mingle 3.0)
-----------------------------------------------------

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
defect_card = m_c.project.cards.first

defect_card.transitions

L) Execute a transition on a card
---------------------------------

m_c = Mingle4r::MingleClient.new('http://localhost:8080', 'testuser', 'password')
m_c.proj_id = 'great_mingle_project'
defect_card = m_c.project.cards.first

defect_card.execute_transition(
 'name'/'transition' => name of the transition to execute exactly s in Mingle(required in 2,3 but
not required in 3.0)
 'comment' => comment for the transition, required only if the transition requires a comment
 'Property Name as in Mingle exactly' => 'Property value to set for the property', required only
if the transition requires to be set manually.
)

== REQUIREMENTS:

1) active_resource gem, it would be automatically taken care of
during gem install.

== INSTALL:

since github no longer archives gems, I am hosting the gem at gemcutter. So you would need to
add http://gemcutter.org to your gem sources : gem sources -a 'http://gemcutter.org'. Then do

gem install mingle4r
