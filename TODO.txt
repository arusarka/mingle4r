will be fixed/implemented very soon
-----------------------------------

* move conversion of the attributes hash to simpler form for properties of type user, card and tree relationship property while 'getting' a card instead of while 'saving' it
* fix updation of card properties - fix user types

will be implemented, but not very important for now
----------------------------------------------------

* update documentation - write about executing transitions directly on the transition
* provide a helper method to link to a card
* write tests for project class
* implement card_types for a project
* mingle client should have cards method

will be done when I've no other work
------------------------------------

* clarify in docs difference between custom properties and native properties
* should transtions give the list of properties to be changed directly
