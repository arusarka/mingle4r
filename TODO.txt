will be fixed/implemented very soon
-----------------------------------

* complete manual QA to ensure/prioritize what needs to be done for card object
* performance fixes
* Reformat README in ascii doc format
* provide a way to find a particular card directly instead of searching through the list at the 
  mingle client level
* update README about find_card, cards method available to mingle client object
* update README about mingle_client.valid_credentials?

will be implemented, but not very important for now
----------------------------------------------------

* get rid of active resource
* update documentation - write about executing transitions directly on the transition
* write tests for project class
* implement card_types for a project
* mingle client should have cards method
* investigate setting custom properties at card creation time

will be done when I've no other work
------------------------------------

* clarify in docs difference between custom properties and native properties
* should transtions give the list of properties to be changed directly
